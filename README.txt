Post "install," these are the things I have done:
- Things I added to config.php:
  - 'default_phone_region' => 'US'
  - 'defaultapp' => 'files,dashboard'
  - 'preview_max_memory' => 512 (to make previews for large files work)
  - 'enabledPreviewProviders' array to make previews for specific filetypes
    - this relies on ffmpeg and imagemagick being installed via custom Dockerfile
    - also did 'docker exec -it --user www-data nc_app sh' and occ preview:repair, y at prompt, not sure if this was necessary but idk
  - 'trashbin_retention_obligation' => '30,365'
  - 'versions_retention_obligation' => '30,365'
- I added my email smtp stuff manually in the browser UI (didn't want to put the pw in an .env or such)
